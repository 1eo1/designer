# Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and `cd` in
2. From the root of the project run `bower install`
3. Start a local server (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` works well for most)
4. Navigate to http://localhost:[YOUR SERVER PORT]

## Things to know

You may notice a few 404s in the console. You can safely ignore these. We use these elements on the Polymer team but they're required for designer to work.
