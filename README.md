# designer2
A UI Designer for Polymer

## Developing

  * Install Bower and npm Dependencies:

        bower install
        npm install

  * Start the local development server:

        npm start

  * Navigate Chrome Canary to `localhost:8080/` to see the demo interface.

  * All bower components are available at
    `localhost:8080/component/{component-name}/`

## Building

We use browserify to make parse5 available in the browser. When updating
parse5 run, run:

    browserify src/parse5/parse5_modulate.js -o src/parse5/parse5.js

## Tests

designer2 does not use WCT *yet*. Tests are run individually by accessing a test
HTML file directly via a `/component/` URL, such as
[http://localhost:8080/component/polymer-designer/test/path/path_test.html]()

## Browser Support

Designer uses some very new browser APIs like `Document.elementsFromPoint`
that are only available in Chrome Canary.

We will work to build rough polyfills and/or use vendor prefixed
versions like `msElementsFromPoint`. Until then, Designer requires
Chrome Canary.

The pages and components edited by Designer can run in any browsers that they
support, that is, you could edit a page that targets legacy browsers like IE5.
